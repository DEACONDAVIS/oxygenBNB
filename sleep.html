            <h2>Places to Stay</h2>
            <p>There are many places to stay when you go on vacation, some of which are nicer than others. No one wants to stay somewhere gross! Thats why we have complied a list of places you could sleep for free, with a quality comparable to a motel 6 or a super 8.</p>
            <p>1. A luxurious suite, where it doesn't matter where you lay down, because the whole suite is a bed.</p>

            <p>2. A small but cozy stay with a water bed. Make sure you sleep sitting up though. </p>

            <p>3. A warm rustic building, with excellent scneary. I've been told by my manager to give a warning to anyone who wants to stay here, that we have no idea what is inside, and we think it might be a portal to detriot so we advise you stay away.</p>
